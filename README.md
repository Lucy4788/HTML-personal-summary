<h2>Project goals: </h2>
<p>This project was one of my very first webpages created as parts of my self-taught coding course on freecodingcamp.com. <br>
  I then followed more courses on codecademy.com and learn more about advance CSS (i.e. flex-box, transition, position) which allowed me to re-code the project in better ways. <br> </p>
